# Number Guessing Game

## Overview

This program is a simple number guessing game implemented in Python. It demonstrates several fundamental programming skills including random number generation, user input handling, loops, and conditional statements.

## Skills Demonstrated

1. **Random Number Generation**: Uses `random.randint` to generate a random number between 1 and 99.
2. **User Input Handling**: Captures user input and converts it to an integer.
3. **Loops**: Utilizes a `while` loop to allow the user to keep guessing until they guess correctly.
4. **Conditional Statements**: Uses `if-elif-else` statements to provide feedback on the user's guess and to control the game flow.
5. **String Formatting**: Demonstrates the use of f-strings for formatting output messages.

## How to Run the Program

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Copy the code below into a Python file, for example `guessing_game.py`.
3. Open your terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the directory containing the `guessing_game.py` file.
5. Run the program by typing `python guessing_game.py`.
